    "about": "Hello, I'm **Varshitha Vaddi** 👩‍💻. I'm a Full Stack software developer based in the United States 🇺🇸.\n\nI’m someone who thrives on challenges and gets a real kick out of solving tough problems 🧩. Technology is my playground, and when I’m not coding or building solutions, you’ll probably find me at a hackathon 🚀. I’ve teamed up with like-minded innovators to build creative projects under tight deadlines—often making it to the top.\n\nI’m also big on debates, with over 15 structured debates under my belt 🎓. They’ve taught me how to think fast, craft strong arguments, and work closely with a team, even when the pressure’s on 🔥. Outside of tech and debates, I’m a big fan of photography capturing moments, chasing light, and telling stories through images whenever I get the chance 🌍.\n\nThese experiences shaped me into a resourceful problem-solver  who’s not afraid to dive into complex issues head-on . For me, growth never stops 📈. I’m constantly learning, experimenting , and pushing myself to create solutions that have a real-world impact. I’m always up for the next challenge, ready to learn something new 📖 and take things to the next level .",
