    "about": "Hello, I'm **Varshitha Vaddi** 👩‍💻. I'm a Full Stack software developer based in the United States 🇺🇸.\n\nI’m someone who thrives on challenges 💪 and gets a real kick out of solving tough problems 🧩. Technology is my playground 🖥️, and when I’m not coding or building solutions, you’ll probably find me at a hackathon 🚀. I’ve teamed up with like-minded innovators to build creative projects under tight deadlines ⏳—often making it to the top 🏆.\n\nI’m also big on debates 🗣️, with over 15 structured debates under my belt 🎓. They’ve taught me how to think fast 💡, craft strong arguments 💬, and work closely with a team 👥, even when the pressure’s on 🔥. Outside of tech and debates, I’m a big fan of photography 📸—capturing moments, chasing light ✨, and telling stories through images whenever I get the chance 🌍.\n\nThese experiences shaped me into a resourceful problem-solver 🔧 who’s not afraid to dive into complex issues head-on 🔍. For me, growth never stops 📈. I’m constantly learning 📚, experimenting 🔬, and pushing myself to create solutions that have a real-world impact 🌍. I’m always up for the next challenge, ready to learn something new 📖 and take things to the next level 🔝.",
